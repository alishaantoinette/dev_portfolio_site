# Detail oriented, problem solving, creative thinking Front-End Developer.

<p>
As someone educated in Graphic Design & Full Stack Development, I understand the jargon & methodologies of Web Designers & Back End Developers; thus bridging the gap across the web development process. My inquisitiveness, integrity, creativity & overall friendly demeanor have led me to have positive interactions with my peers, co-workers, teachers, managers & more. Furthermore, my personal & professional experiences with leadership, education & communication would prove valuable on a team of fellow motivated professionals. 
<br /><br />
I have a love for the aesthetics and challenges presented in Front End Development. The process of actualizing an idea into a working product that people can interact with & be benefited by is very rewarding for me. As such, I’m continually striving to be better so I welcome feedback & respond accordingly. I'm also a quick learner & collaborative worker who’s dedicated to mutual growth.
<br /><br />
The technologies I work with include, but are not limited to: HTML5, CSS3, SASS, JavaScript, React, Redux, jQuery, Git, Adobe CS, Sketch, MongoDB, Node & Express. In an effort to continually hone my craft and grow as a developer, I'm working on learning new technologies while using best practices. 
<br /><br />
Apart from development & design I enjoy photography, brain games, coaching volleyball & being a basketball fan.
