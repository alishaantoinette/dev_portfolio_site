# Detail oriented, problem solving, creative thinking Front-End Developer.

<p>
  As someone educated in Graphic Design & Full Stack Development, I can "speak the language" of Web Designers & Back End Developers; thus bridging the gap across the web development process. I’m continually striving to be better so I welcome feedback & respond accordingly. Furthermore, my personal & professional experiences with leadership, education & communication would prove valuable on a team of fellow motivated creatives. 
<br /><br />
Apart from development & design I enjoy photography, brain games,  coaching volleyball & being a basketball fan.
