# Detail oriented, problem solving, creative thinking Web Developer.

<p>
Educated in Graphic Design and Web Development, I understand the jargon and methodologies of both disciplines; thus bridging the gap between them. I enjoy creating positive user experiences through beautiful user interfaces from scratch, or with Content Management Systems. I'm continuously working to improve my skillset and I encourage and follow through on feedback regarding my code. My inquisitiveness, integrity, creativity and overall friendly demeanor have led me to have positive interactions with my peers, co-workers, mentors, managers and more. Furthermore, my personal and professional experiences with leadership, education and communication would prove valuable on a team of fellow motivated professionals.
<br /><br />
The technologies I work with include, but are not limited to: HTML5, JavaScript, React, Redux, jQuery, CSS3, SASS, Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, Sketch, Git, Github, MongoDB, Node & Express. 
<br /><br />
Apart from development & design I enjoy photography, brain games, coaching volleyball & being a sports fan (especially basketball).
