# Detail oriented, problem solving, creative thinking Full-Stack Developer.

<p>
As someone educated in Graphic Design and Full Stack Development, I understand the jargon and methodologies of Web Designers and Web Developers; thus bridging the gap across the web development process. My inquisitiveness, integrity, creativity and overall friendly demeanor have led me to have positive interactions with my peers, co-workers, teachers, managers and more. Furthermore, my personal and professional experiences with leadership, education and communication would prove valuable on a team of fellow motivated professionals. 
<br /><br />
I'm a quick learner and collaborative worker who’s dedicated to mutual growth. I have a love for the aesthetics and challenges presented in Front End Development as well as an appreciation for the logic required in Back End Development. The process of actualizing an idea into a working product that people can interact with and be benefited by is also very rewarding for me. As such, I’m continually striving to be better so I welcome feedback and respond accordingly.
<br /><br />
The technologies I work with include, but are not limited to: HTML5, JavaScript, React, Redux, jQuery, CSS3, SASS, Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, Sketch, Git, Github, MongoDB, Node & Express. However, in an effort to continually hone my craft and grow as a creative thinker, I'm often working on learning new technologies while using best practices. 
<br /><br />
Apart from development & design I enjoy photography, brain games, coaching volleyball & being a basketball fan.
