          My name is Alisha, thanks for stopping by.</h2>
        <p className='about-me'> 
          Educated in Graphic Design <em>and</em> Web Development, I understand the jargon and methodologies of both disciplines; thus bridging the gap between them. I enjoy creating positive user experiences through beautiful user interfaces from scratch, or with Content Management Systems. I'm continuously working to improve my skillset and I encourage and follow through on feedback regarding my code. My inquisitiveness, integrity, creativity and overall friendly demeanor have led me to have positive interactions with my peers, co-workers, mentors, managers and more. Furthermore, my personal and professional experiences with leadership, education and communication would prove valuable on a team of fellow motivated professionals.               
          <br /><br />
          Apart from development & design I enjoy photography
            (<Link to='/photos' className='link about-link'>see here</Link>)
          , brain games, coaching volleyball and being a sports fan (especially basketball ðŸ˜Ž).
